      Taylor Alison Swift (Pennsylvania, 1989) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress, and one of the
      best-selling recording artists in the world, with over 50 million albums and 150 million digital downloads. Known
      for her lyrics based on personal experiences, she developed an interest in music from a young age, participating
      in karaoke and musical theater productions. She even won a local talent contest, which awarded her the opportunity
      to perform as the opening act for musician Charlie Daniels.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the age of 14, she moved to Nashville to pursue her career as a country artist with the record label Big
      Machine Records, becoming the youngest artist signed by Sony/ATV Music Publishing House. With them, she released
      her debut album "Taylor Swift" (2006), which established her as a country music sensation and earned her a Grammy
      nomination for Best New Artist. The album spawned the singles "Tim McGraw" (her favorite country singer),
      "Teardrops on My Guitar," and "Our Song," which quickly climbed to the top of the country charts.
      Two years later, her second album, 'Fearless,' was released, and its singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me"
      once again dominated the charts. The album, which became the most awarded in the history of country music, won 4
      Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year (making her the youngest artist to achieve this), as well as American
      Music Awards, Academy of Country Music Awards, and Country Music Association Awards. Additionally, the song
      "Change" was featured in the U.S. Olympic soundtrack for the Beijing Olympics, and the music video for "Love
      Story" received an MTV award for Best Female Video (although rapper Kanye West famously interrupted the acceptance
      speech, stating that Beyonc√© deserved the award). Swift's fame even led her to make a guest appearance on an
      episode of the TV series CSI in 2009.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her third album, "Speak Now," was released in 2010 and featured singles such as "Mean," "Mine," and "Back to
      December." It sold over one and a half million copies in its first week in the United States. That same year, she
      made her film debut with a supporting role in the movie 'Valentine's Day,' in which she also contributed to the
      soundtrack. In 2012, she released 'Red,' her fourth album, featuring the chart-topping song "We Are Never Ever
      Getting Back Together," which reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, and "I Knew You Were Trouble," which
      gained worldwide fame. Throughout her career, Swift's style has evolved towards pop music, as demonstrated in her
      fifth album, '1989.' With this album, she became the first and only artist to have three albums sell over a
      million copies in a single week. The album includes songs like "Shake It Off," showcasing a clear commercial pop
      style. Notably, the music video for "Bad Blood" set the record for the most views in a single day in YouTube
      history, with over twenty million views.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2017, she released 'Reputation,' considered her darkest album, which once again broke records on YouTube with
      the music video for "Look What You Made Me Do." It became the most viewed video on YouTube within the first 24
      hours, accumulating over 43 million views.
    </p>
    <p>
      With "Lover," her seventh album, the artist returns to her romantic roots with songs like "Me!," which have
      playful lyrics and a whimsical music video. In addition to this project, Swift was part of the cast of the film
      adaptation of the Broadway musical "Cats." In 2020, she released two albums, shifting towards a more traditional
      American folk sound with "Folklore" and "Evermore." She also premiered the documentary "Miss Americana" on
      Netflix, which explores her career. In 2022, she appeared in the film "Amsterdam" and announced her tenth studio
      album, "Midnights," which features thirteen songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her personal life, Swift has had a busy romantic journey, being associated with singers and actors such as Joe
      Jonas, John Mayer (both of whom have written songs about her), Taylor Lautner, Jake Gyllenhaal, Harry Styles,
      Calvin Harris, Tom Hiddleston, and the model and actor Joe Alwyn (known for his roles in "The Favourite" and
      "Harriet"), with whom she is currently in a relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is also known for her active involvement in advocating for arts education, children's literacy, disaster
      relief funds, LGBT rights, and charitable institutions for sick children. Among her notable achievements, she has
      been recognized by the Nashville Songwriters Association and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. She has won 10 Grammy
      Awards, an Emmy, 22 Billboard Music Awards, 23 American Music Awards, 6 MTV Video Music Awards, 11 Country Music
      Association Awards, and has received 2 Golden Globe nominations.
